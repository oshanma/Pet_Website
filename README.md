## **Overview**

This project is a front-end web application designed to efficiently manage pet records in a shelter. It offers a digital platform for tracking and maintaining details of pets, such as their breed, age, health status, and adoption status. The application features a responsive main page displaying pet cards and a detailed page for individual pets.

## **Recent Updates**

### **Key Changes** 
- Replaced data.json with data.js: The project now loads pet data from a JavaScript file instead of a JSON file.
- Updated scripts.js: Adjusted the logic to directly access the petsData variable from data.js.
- Removed data.json: Since JavaScript natively supports object arrays, using a JSON file for static data was unnecessary.

### **Why Use data.js Instead of data.json?**
- Direct Variable Access: A JavaScript file (data.js) allows direct access to data as a global variable, eliminating the need for a fetch() request.
- Faster Load Time: By avoiding an asynchronous fetch operation, the page loads data immediately without waiting for an external request.
- Simplified Implementation: data.js allows for easier integration into JavaScript functions without requiring additional error handling for fetch failures.
- More Flexibility: With data.js, we can manipulate and modify pet data within the script dynamically.
